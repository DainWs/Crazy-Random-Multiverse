# ðŸ§  AI System Documentation

## Overview

The **AI System** is a feature designed to introduce artificial intelligence-driven behaviors and actions within the game, allowing the AI to act as a player. This system provides the foundation for future expansions, enabling the AI to make decisions and interact with the game environment dynamically.

### Core Implementation

The core functionality of the AI System has been developed to handle the following:

- **AI Decision-Making Logic**: A modular and flexible structure for AI-driven decisions based on game states.
- **Game State Tracking**: A system that monitors the game environment and provides relevant data to the AI for better decision-making.
- **Basic Integration**: Seamless integration of the AI into the game loop, allowing it to participate as a player in various scenarios.

The core is designed to be highly modular, making it easy for contributors to extend and customize the AI's behaviors.

## Core Features

1. **AI Core Module**  
   - Implemented a basic decision-making structure, focusing on handling different game states and player actions.
   - Developed a foundation for AI adaptability based on changing game conditions.

2. **Integration with the Game Loop**  
   - Integrated the AI as an additional player in the game loop, ensuring it can participate in game mechanics without disrupting performance.
   
3. **Modular Design**  
   - Created a flexible architecture that allows for future extensions and customization by contributors.

## What shoul i implement to use this feature?

If you're interested in extending the AI system, there are several areas you can do:

1. **Advanced AI Behaviors**  
   - Create new actions and behaviors for the AI player (e.g., strategic moves, complex responses).
   - Implement more sophisticated decision trees or machine learning algorithms to enhance AI intelligence.

2. **Environment Interaction**  
   - Allow the AI to interact with the game environment in unique ways (e.g., dynamic pathfinding, environmental awareness).
   - Adapt AI behaviors to specific game scenarios or levels for a more diverse player experience.

3. **Testing and Optimizations**  
   - Help with testing AI behaviors and optimizing performance.
   - Suggest improvements for AI responsiveness and adaptability to different game conditions.
