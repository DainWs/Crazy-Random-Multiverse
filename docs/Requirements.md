 - **Leader Protection:** To protect your leader, you can place Warrior cards on the rows of the board that protect him.

 - **Equipments:** These cards can be equipped to Warrior or Leader cards to enhance their capabilities. Upgrading your cards with equipment can be an essential strategy to gain an advantage in the game.
 - **Spells:** Spell cards have varied effects and can change the rules of the game. Some spells can be beneficial, while others can be harmful. Choosing when and how to use spells is crucial.

 - **Rounds:** In each round a specific set of cards is dealt to the players, for example, in Round 2 all players receive 1 Pop and 1 Common cards.
 - **Start and Turns:** The game will be started by a random player in the game. During your turn, you can perform actions such as playing a card, attacking other players' cards, using spells, etc.
 - **Winning the Game:** The game continues until one of the leaders is eliminated. The player whose leader survives wins the game. Additionally, if one member of a team wins, all allies, living or dead, also win.
